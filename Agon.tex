I see now through a glass darkly
The truth in fragments
In the errors of the world,
We must spell out its signals
Even when they seem obscure,
With a will bent on suffering.
The monk must rise in darkness
And pray at length in darkness,
Waiting for light of day,
Illuminating the shadows
With the flame of his devotion.
All bow toward the altar
In a moment of meditation,
In these hours of mystic ardour
And intense inner peace,
That no-one else can comprehend.
Waiting to be lost
In the bottomless pit
Of silence and divinity.
I have been taught
To recognise the signs
Through which the world
Speaks to us like a great book.
The order to oppose
The race to the abysm.
Dictated to our prophets,
Custodians of the void,
Repeated without changing a word.
Objects of wondrous beauty
Shine in the glow of the sun
As shapes of things and animals
Suddenly rise from the void.
The weak sun is beating
Almost straight down
And plunges my mind
Into a violent vision
That my tongue can hardly describe.
The eyes wide and glaring
Over a terrestrial mankind
That has finally reached
The end of its cruel story.
As if shoulders and neck were twisted
In a fierce impulse,
With flanks tensed,
Limbs of a dying animal,
Serpent-like tails coiled and writhing,
Culminating at the top,
In pillars of fire.
Their bodies are inhabited
In every part by the void,
Struck by revelation,
Faces painted with apathy,
Eyes shining with fervour,
Pupils dilated by zeal,
Bony hands raised to the sky
With fingers splayed like wings,
Howling their own damnation
As the sound of many waters,
From throats obscene and dry,
Roaring in adoration
Of what is to come upon us.
Supreme bliss in having lost all,
A champion of poverty,
Perfect despiser of the world,
This is what I wish to become.
Radiance of the sun eternal,
An invitation of my spirit
To lose all memory in bliss,
That extends and enlarges man
And the gaping chasm
He bears within himself
Is no longer easily sealed,
A wound cut by the living void.
Driven by such a hope,
As if refusing to recognise
The world as a vale of tears
Where even injustice
Is foreordained by providence
To maintain the balance
Of a hostile scheme
Whose design eludes us.
At once mother and whore,
Screaming and railing in lust
Like a poisonous snake in heat;
Physical beauty is fleeting
And must be considered base.
As my body grows older
And as I abandon myself
To the will of the void,
As the only element of reason
I recognise the will
To endure and to wait.

Weary and detached from the things of this world
Bedecked with flowers
Torn and dirty habit
Holding up one finger as if in admonition
Immersed in gloom
Justify their carnal life
You hide your face in your hands
The void can be named only through the most distorted things
All these are as smoke then dispersed by the strong wind of faith
Beautiful and terrible as an army arrayed for battle
Nothing exists that so fills and binds the heart as love does
Unless you have those weapons that subdue it, the soul plunges through love into an immense abyss
On this side the choir of angels, on that the gaping maw of hell
With the steadfastness of martyrs or the arrogance of the damned
Sons will raise their hands against their fathers, servants will disobey their masters, there will be no more respect for the old, the young will demand to rule, work will seem a useless chore to all, everywhere songs will rise praising dissolute liberty of behaviour, sins against nature will follow in a great wave
The feast transforms into the universal slaughter and here we see its final result, stretched out to its full extent like the hide of a skinned and hung animal, which still contained, however, petrified, the leather sinews, the viscera, and all the organs, and even the features of the face
The horny formations under the heel, the threads of the lashes, the watery substance of the eyes, the flesh of the lips, the thin spine of the back, the architecture of the bones, everything reduced to sandy powder
The legs emptied and limp as a boat, their flesh lying flat like chasuble with all the scarlet embroidery of the veins, the engraved pile of the viscera, the intense and mucous ruby of the heart, the tongue as a pink-and-blue pendant, the fingers in a row like tapers, the unrolled carpet of the belly
What first triumphed in its folly and took delight in its jesting now is here punished and rewarded, liberated from the seduction of the passions, rigidified by eternity, consigned to the eternal frost that is to preserve and purify it, saved from corruption through the triumph of corruption
Restored to its original form
And what would we be without fear, perhaps the most foresighted of our gifts
When he laughs, as the wine gurgles in his throat, the servant feels he is master, because he has overturned his position with respect to his lord
The people are transformed into an assembly belched forth from the abysms of the unknown earth
I shall be in the simple foundation, in the silent desert where diversity is never seen
I shall fall into the silent and uninhabited divinity where there is no work and no image
