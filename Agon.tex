I see now through a glass darkly
The truth in fragments
In the errors of the world,
We must spell out its signals
Even when they seem obscure,
With a will bent on suffering.

The monk must rise in darkness
And pray at length in darkness,
Waiting for light of day,
Illuminating the shadows
With the flame of his devotion.

All bow toward the altar
In a moment of meditation,
In these hours of mystic ardour
And intense inner peace,
That no-one else can comprehend.

I am waiting to be lost
In the bottomless pit
Of silence and divinity
Where there is no work, no image.

I have been taught
To recognise the signs
Through which the world
Speaks to us like a great book.

Dictated to our prophets,
Custodians of the void,
Without changing a single word,
It was the order to oppose
The race to the abysm.

Objects of wondrous beauty
Shine in the glow of the sun
As shapes of things and animals
Suddenly rise from the void.

The weak sun is beating
Almost straight down
And plunges my mind
Into a violent vision
That my tongue can hardly describe.

The eyes wide and glaring
Over a terrestrial mankind
That has finally reached
The end of its cruel story.

As if shoulders and neck were twisted
In a fierce impulse,
With flanks tensed,
Limbs of a dying animal,
Serpent-like tails coiled and writhing,
Culminating at the top,
In pillars of fire.

The feast has been transformed
Into the universal slaughter
And we see its final result,
Stretched out to its full extent
Like the hide of a skinned animal,
Its sinews, the viscera,
And its petrified organs,
And even features of the face,
Horny formations under the heel,
The thin threads of the lashes,
The runny substance of the eyes,
The dark flesh of the lips,
The delicate spine of the back,
The fragile structure of the bones,
The flesh lying flat like a robe,
The embroidery of the veins,
The scarlet pile of viscera,
The tongue as a blue pendant,
The unrolled carpet of the belly,
The intense ruby of the heart,
No longer pumping potent drugs,
Everything reduced to powder.

Their bodies are inhabited
In every part by the void,
Struck by revelation,
Faces painted with apathy,
Eyes shining with fervour,
Pupils dilated by zeal,
Bony hands raised to the sky
With fingers splayed like wings,
Howling their own damnation
As the sound of many waters,
From throats obscene and dry,
Roaring in adoration
Of what is to come upon us.

The son will slay his father,
With beer gurgling in his throat,
Overturning his position
With respect to his former lord,
The servant feels he is master,
No-one will respect the old,
The young will demand to rule,
With dissolute behaviour,
Work will seem a useless chore,
Sins against nature will follow.

Supreme bliss in having lost all,
A champion of poverty,
Perfect despiser of the world,
This is what I wish to become.

Radiance of the sun eternal,
An invitation of my spirit
To lose all memory in bliss,
That extends and enlarges man
And the gaping chasm
He bears within himself
Is no longer easily sealed,
A wound cut by the living void.

Driven by such a hope,
As if refusing to recognise
The world as a vale of tears
Where even injustice
Is foreordained by providence
To maintain the balance
Of a hostile scheme
Whose design eludes us.

At once mother and whore,
Screaming and railing in lust
Like a poisonous snake in heat
But her beauty is fleeting
And must be considered base.

As my body grows older
And as I abandon myself
To the will of the void,
As the only element of reason
I recognise the will
To endure and to wait.

Without the precious weapons
That can subdue and tame the mind
The soul will tumble and plunge
Through existential terrors
Into an immense abysm
For what would we be without fear,
The most foresighted of our gifts
That restores the mind of man
To its original form.

Weary and detached from the things of this world
Bedecked with flowers
Torn and dirty habit
Holding up one finger as if in admonition
Immersed in gloom
Justify their carnal life
You hide your face in your hands
The void can be named only through the most distorted things
All these are as smoke then dispersed by the strong wind of faith
Beautiful and terrible as an army arrayed for battle
Nothing exists that so fills and binds the heart as love does
On this side the choir of angels, on that the gaping maw of hell
With the steadfastness of martyrs or the arrogance of the damned
What first triumphed in its folly and took delight in its jesting now is here punished and rewarded, liberated from the seduction of the passions, rigidified by eternity, consigned to the eternal frost that is to preserve and purify it, saved from corruption through the triumph of corruption
The people are transformed into an assembly belched forth from the abysms of the unknown earth
I shall be in the simple foundation, in the silent desert where diversity is never seen
