I see now, through a glass darkly, the truth
In fragments in the errors of my world,
Spelling out its signals, in submission,
Even when their meaning remains obscure,
Endowed with a will bent on suffering.
Waiting to be lost in deepest abysms
Of silence, divinity and dying.
I have been taught to recognise the signs
Through which the world speaks to us like a book.
The order to oppose the vile abyss
Was dictated to the holy prophets,
Custodians of emptiness divine,
Transmitted without changing any word.
Led by vision that no tongue can describe,
The weak sun is beating almost straight down,
Weary, detached from the things of this world.
My eyes glare over a fading mankind,
That roars loudly in great adoration
Of what is to come, that will drown our world.
As if shoulders and neck twisted fiercely,
Flanks tensed, limbs those of a dying creature,
Maw open, serpent-like tails coiled, writhing,
Reaching its climax in pillars of fire.
Bodies inhabited in every part
By the void profound, by the living void,
Illuminated by revelation,
Their faces overcome with amazement,
Eyes shining with fervour, cheeks flushed with love,
And pupils dilated with utmost joy,
Their bony hands raised, fingers splayed like wings,
And veins pulsing with drugs, in flight from death,
In flight from life, in flight from man himself,
Howling damnation from a throat obscene,
The voice as the sound of many waters.
Here he comes, champion of poverty,
Clothed in torn and dirty habit, behold
His finger held up in admonition,
Immersed in carnal life, immersed in gloom,
Fading world, face hidden in filthy hands.
Only through most distorted things, the name
Of the void, ineffable, may be heard.
In darkness he rises, to pray at length,
Shadows expulsed by flames of devotion,
At last, the light of day he sought and loves.
Mother, whore, railing in lust like a snake,
Progenitor, harlot, serpent in heat,
Split tongue, world splitting in deafening noise.
Prostrate before the altar, in moments
Of meditation, none can comprehend,
Filled with mystic ardour and inner peace,
As objects close and objects far vanish
Into irrelevance, the gaping void,
For they are as smoke, dispersed by the wind
Of faith and perfect despisers we are,
Of a fading world in which we lost all.
Driven by such hope, as if refusing
To recognise this our world as a vale
Of tears and blight where even injustice
Is foreordained to maintain the balance
Of a hostile scheme of unknown design.
There is nothing that fills and binds the heart
As fear does; what would we be without it,
The most foresighted of our precious gifts.

Beautiful and terrible as an army arrayed for battle
Unless you have those weapons that subdue it, the soul plunges thorugh love into an immense abyss
On this side the choir of angels, on that the gaping maw of hell
With the steadfastness of martyrs or the arrogance of the damned
Physical beauty is fleeting and must be considered base
The invitation of my whole spirit to lose all memory in bliss was surely the radiance of the eternal sun; and the joy that produces opens, extends, enlarges man and the gaping chasm man bears within himself is no longer sealed so easily, for it is the wound cut by the blow of the sword of the void
Shapes, of things and animals, seemed to rise suddenly from the void
The older I grow and the more I abandon myself to the will of the void, the less I value intelligence that wants to know and will that wants to do, and as the only element of reason I recognise the will to endure and to wait
Sons will raise their hands against their fathers, servants will disobey their masters, there will be no more respect for the old, the young will demand to rule, work will seem a useless chore to all, everywhere songs will rise praising dissolute lliberty of behaviour, sins against nature will follow in a great wave
Objects of wondrous beauty shine in the glow of the sun
The feast transforms into the universal slaughter and here we see its final result, stretched out to its full extent like the hide of a skinned and hung animal, which still contained, however, petrified, the leather sinews, the viscera, and all the organs, and even the features of the face
The horny formations under the heel, the threads of the lashes, the watery substance of the eyes, the flesh of the lips, the thin spine of the back, the architecture of the bones, everything reduced to sandy powder
The legs emptied and limp as a boat, their flesh lying flat like chasuble with all the scarlet embroidery of the veins, the engraved pile of the viscera, the intense and mucous ruby of the heart, the tongue as a pink-and-blue pendant, the fingers in a row like tapers, the unrolled carpet of the belly
What first triumphed in its folly and took delight in its jesting now is here punished and rewarded, liberated from the seduction of the passions, rigidified by eternity, consigned to the eternal frost that is to preserve and purify it, saved from corruption through the triumph of corruption
Restored to its original form
When he laughs, as the wine gurgles in his throat, the servant feels he is master, because he has overturned his position with respect to his lord
The people are transformed into an asembly belched forth from the abysms of the unknown earth
I shall be in the simple foundation, in the silent desert where diversity is never seen
I shall fall into the silent and uninhabited divinity where there is no work and no image
