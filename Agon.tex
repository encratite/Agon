I see now, through a glass darkly, the truth
In fragments in the errors of my world,
I must spell out its unfaithful signals,
Even when their meaning remains obscure,
As if endowed with a will bent on pain.
Waiting to be lost in deepest abysms
Of silence, divinity and dying.
I have been taught to recognise the signs
Through which the world speaks to us like a book.
The order to oppose the vile abyss
Was dictated to the holy prophets,
Custodians of emptiness divine,
Transmitted without changing any word.
Led by vision that no tongue can describe,
The weak sun is beating almost straight down,
Weary, detached from the things of this world.
My eyes glare over a fading mankind,
That roars loudly in great adoration
Of what is to come, that will drown our world.
As if shoulders and neck twisted fiercely,
Flanks tensed, limbs those of a dying creature,
Maw open, serpent-like tails coiled, writhing,
Reaching its climax in pillars of fire.
Bodies inhabited in every part
By the void profound, by the living void,
Illuminated by revelation,
Their faces overcome with amazement,
Eyes shining with fervour, cheeks flushed with love,
And pupils dilated with utmost joy.

Their long bony hands raised, the fingers splayed like wings
Howling its own damnation from an obscene throat
His voice as the sound of many waters
Torn and dirty habit
Holding up one finger as if in admonition
Immersed in gloom
Justify their carnal life
A champion of poverty
You hide your face in your hands
Transformed into a harlot, she rails in lust like a snake in heat
The void can be named only through the most distorted things
The monk must rise in darkness and pray at length in darkness waiting for day and illuminating the shadows with the flame of devotion
All bowed toward the altar in a moment of meditation whose sweetness no-one can comprehend who has not experienced these hours of mystic ardour and intense inner peace
All these are as smoke then dispersed by the strong wind of faith
Driven by such a hope, as if refusing to recognise the world as a vale of tears where even injustice is foreordained by providence to maintain the balance of things whose design eludes us
Beautiful and terrible as an army arrayed for battle
Nothing exists that so fills and binds the heart as love does
Unless you have those weapons that subdue it, the soul plunges thorugh love into an immense abyss
On this side the choir of angels, on that the gaping maw of hell
With the steadfastness of martyrs or the arrogance of the damned
Physical beauty is fleeting and must be considered base
The supreme bliss in having lost all
The invitation of my whole spirit to lose all memory in bliss was surely the radiance of the eternal sun; and the joy that produces opens, extends, enlarges man and the gaping chasm man bears within himself is no longer sealed so easily, for it is the wound cut by the blow of the sword of the void
Shapes, of things and animals, seemed to rise suddenly from the void
Perfect despisers of the world
The older I grow and the more I abandon myself to the will of the void, the less I value intelligence that wants to know and will that wants to do, and as the only element of reason I recognise the will to endure and to wait
Sons will raise their hands against their fathers, servants will disobey their masters, there will be no more respect for the old, the young will demand to rule, work will seem a useless chore to all, everywhere songs will rise praising dissolute lliberty of behaviour, sins against nature will follow in a great wave
Objects of wondrous beauty shine in the glow of the sun
The feast transforms into the universal slaughter and here we see its final result, stretched out to its full extent like the hide of a skinned and hung animal, which still contained, however, petrified, the leather sinews, the viscera, and all the organs, and even the features of the face
The horny formations under the heel, the threads of the lashes, the watery substance of the eyes, the flesh of the lips, the thin spine of the back, the architecture of the bones, everything reduced to sandy powder
The legs emptied and limp as a boat, their flesh lying flat like chasuble with all the scarlet embroidery of the veins, the engraved pile of the viscera, the intense and mucous ruby of the heart, the tongue as a pink-and-blue pendant, the fingers in a row like tapers, the unrolled carpet of the belly
What first triumphed in its folly and took delight in its jesting now is here punished and rewarded, liberated from the seduction of the passions, rigidified by eternity, consigned to the eternal frost that is to preserve and purify it, saved from corruption through the triumph of corruption
Restored to its original form
And what would we be without fear, perhaps the most foresighted of our gifts
When he laughs, as the wine gurgles in his throat, the servant feels he is master, because he has overturned his position with respect to his lord
The people are transformed into an asembly belched forth from the abysms of the unknown earth
I shall be in the simple foundation, in the silent desert where diversity is never seen
I shall fall into the silent and uninhabited divinity where there is no work and no image
