%Umberto Eco: The Name of the Rose

\begin{stanza}
I see now through a glass= darkly the truth
In fragments= in the errors= of the world,
I spell out its= signals=, even when obscure,
As if amalgamated with a will
Wholly bent on crushing the race of man.
\end{stanza}

\iffalse
Waiting to be lost in the bottomless pit of silence and divinity
I have been teaching you to recognise the evidence through which the world speaks to us like a great book
The order to oppose the race to the abyss
Dictated to the prophets, repeated without changing a syllable
Custodians of the divine word
Weary and detached from the things of this world
The weak sun is beating almost straight down and plunged me into a vision that my tongue can hardly describe
The eyes wide and glaring over a terrestrial mankind that had reached the end of its story
Bedecked with flowers
Roaring in adoration of what is to come
As if shoulders and neck twisted in a fierce impulse, flanks tensed, the limbs those of a dying animal, maw open, serpent-like tails coiled and writhing, culminating at the top, in tongues of flame
Bodies inhabited in every part by the spirit, illuminated by revelation, faces overcome with amazement, eyes shining with enthusiasm, cheeks flushed with love, pupils dilated with joy
Their long bony hands raised, the fingers splayed like wings
Howling its own damnation from an obscene throat
His voice as the sound of many waters
Torn and dirty habit
Holding up one finger as if in admonition
Immersed in gloom
Justify their carnal life
A champion of poverty
You hide your face in your hands
Transformed into a harlot, she rails in lust like a snake in heat
The void can be named only through the most distorted things
The monk must rise in darkness and pray at length in darkness waiting for day and illuminating the shadows with the flame of devotion
All bowed toward the altar in a moment of meditation whose sweetness no-one can comprehend who has not experienced these hours of mystic ardour and intense inner peace
All these are as smoke then dispersed by the strong wind of faith
Driven by such a hope, as if refusing to recognise the world as a vale of tears where even injustice is foreordained by providence to maintain the balance of things whose design eludes us
Beautiful and terrible as an army arrayed for battle
Nothing exists that so fills and binds the heart as love does
Unless you have those weapons that subdue it, the soul plunges through love into an immense abyss
On this side the choir of angels, on that the gaping maw of hell
With the steadfastness of martyrs or the arrogance of the damned
Physical beauty is fleeting and must be considered base
The supreme bliss in having lost all
The invitation of my whole spirit to lose all memory in bliss was surely the radiance of the eternal sun; and the joy that produces opens, extends, enlarges man and the gaping chasm man bears within himself is no longer sealed so easily, for it is the wound cut by the blow of the sword of the void
Shapes, of things and animals, seemed to rise suddenly from the void
Perfect despisers of the world
The older I grow and the more I abandon myself to the will of the void, the less I value intelligence that wants to know and will that wants to do, and as the only element of reason I recognise the will to endure and to wait
Sons will raise their hands against their fathers, servants will disobey their masters, there will be no more respect for the old, the young will demand to rule, work will seem a useless chore to all, everywhere songs will rise praising dissolute liberty of behaviour, sins against nature will follow in a great wave
Objects of wondrous beauty shine in the glow of the sun
The feast transforms into the universal slaughter and here we see its final result, stretched out to its full extent like the hide of a skinned and hung animal, which still contained, however, petrified, the leather sinews, the viscera, and all the organs, and even the features of the face
The horny formations under the heel, the threads of the lashes, the watery substance of the eyes, the flesh of the lips, the thin spine of the back, the architecture of the bones, everything reduced to sandy powder
The legs emptied and limp as a boat, their flesh lying flat like chasuble with all the scarlet embroidery of the veins, the engraved pile of the viscera, the intense and mucous ruby of the heart, the tongue as a pink-and-blue pendant, the fingers in a row like tapers, the unrolled carpet of the belly
What first triumphed in its folly and took delight in its jesting now is here punished and rewarded, liberated from the seduction of the passions, rigidified by eternity, consigned to the eternal frost that is to preserve and purify it, saved from corruption through the triumph of corruption
Restored to its original form
And what would we be without fear, perhaps the most foresighted of our gifts
When he laughs, as the wine gurgles in his throat, the servant feels he is master, because he has overturned his position with respect to his lord
The people are transformed into an assembly belched forth from the abysms of the unknown earth
I shall be in the simple foundation, in the silent desert where diversity is never seen
I shall fall into the silent and uninhabited divinity where there is no work and no image
